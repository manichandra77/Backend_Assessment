# Credit Approval System API

This project is a backend system built with Django and Django Rest Framework to manage a credit approval system. It provides a set of RESTful APIs to register customers, check loan eligibility based on a dynamic credit score, and create and view loans. The entire application is containerized using Docker and uses Celery with Redis for asynchronous data ingestion from Excel files.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- **Customer Registration**: Add new customers and automatically calculate an `approved_limit` based on their salary.
- **Dynamic Credit Scoring**: Check loan eligibility by calculating a credit score based on historical loan data. The score considers factors like past EMIs paid on time, number of loans, and current debt.
- **Loan Creation**: Create new loans for eligible customers.
- **Loan Viewing**: Retrieve details for a specific loan or view all loans associated with a customer.
- **Asynchronous Data Ingestion**: Load initial customer and loan data from Excel files using Celery background workers.
- **Containerized Environment**: Fully containerized with Docker and Docker Compose for easy setup and deployment.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have the following software installed on your machine:
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (usually included with Docker Desktop)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/manichandra77/Backend_Assessment
    cd credit_system
    ```

2.  **Place Data Files**
    -   Place the `customer_data.xlsx` and `loan_data.xlsx` files into the root directory of the project (the same folder as `docker-compose.yml`).

3.  **Build and Start the Containers**
    -   Open a terminal in the project root and run the following command. This will build the Docker images and start the Django app, PostgreSQL database, Redis, and Celery worker.
    ```sh
    docker-compose up -d --build
    ```

4.  **Run Database Migrations**
    -   Apply the database migrations to create the necessary tables.
    ```sh
    docker-compose exec app python manage.py migrate
    ```

5.  **Ingest Initial Data**
    -   Run the command to load the customer and loan data from the Excel files into the database.
    ```sh
    docker-compose exec app python manage.py ingest_data
    ```

The application is now running and accessible at `http://localhost:8000`.
